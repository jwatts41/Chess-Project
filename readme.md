<!-- Title of the Project/Game -->
WolfPack Chess
-Made to be played with 2 users

<!-- Inspiration for the Game -->
Chess was one of th first board games I learned how to play, it was a game I learned when I was younger at a camp and a game that me and my family used to play on Sundays. The game teaches patience and critcal thinking and that is something that can also be applied to real life situations.

<!-- How to Play the Game -->
The game is played using a drag and drop feature for each piece, the goal of the game is to collect the opposite team's king or put him in a position where he can no longer move to any available spots. When that is done this is called Checkmate. Each piece has its own unique move set based on the rules of chess.

<!-- MoveSet for each piece -->
-Pawn: can move vertically forward 2 spots if it is the first move. After the first move pawns are only allowed to move 1 spot forward, if an enemy is present within 1 diagonol spot of the pawn, the pawn is allowed to move 1 spot diagnolly to capture the enemy piece.

-Rook: can move vertically or horizontally across the whole board if the spots are open. If other pieces are present, the Rook can not move through these pieces, if its an enemy piece it must capture that piece, if its a friendly team piece it blocks the path of the Rook.

-Bishops: can move diagonally across the whole board if the spots are open. If other pieces are present, the bishop can not move through these pieces, if its an enemy piece it must capture that piece, if its a friendly team piece it blocks the path of the bishop.

-Knights: can move in a L shape that consists of either 2 spots vertically and 1 spot horizontal or 2 spots horizontally and 1 spot vertical. Unlike the other pieces, the knight can jump over all pieces and get to its desried path that fits its moveset.

-Queens: Can move vertically, horizontally or diagonally any number of spots, but just like the bishop and the rook, the Queen cannot move through pieces that are in its path. The Queen is considered the most valuable piece on the board.

-King: Can move 1 square vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The king is the piece that needs to be protected the most, if you lose your king....you lose the game!!
